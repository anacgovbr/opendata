What is a persistent URL?

A persistent URL is one that never changes. Persistent URLs are designed so that your bookmarks and links don't break when a website gets updated.

The PURL concept allows people to curate HTTP URIs. PURLs let third-party control over URL resolution and resource metadata. If a Web resource moves to a different place, the URL that points to it can be changed. A PURL user always uses the same web address, even though the resource may have changed.
